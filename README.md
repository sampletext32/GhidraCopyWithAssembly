This repository holds my ghidra scripts that I use to copy-paste active function with it's assembly from Ghidra to LLM.

Also there is a file with quick typedef export from cursor to clipboard.

I've assigned it to Ctrl+Shift+C for convenience.

You're free to use it.

Leave a star if it helped you.
